# Uniform Cost Search (UCS) Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)** algorithm in Python. The code solves a graph search problem as described in an Artificial Intelligence lab task.

The goal of the UCS algorithm is to find the least-cost paths from a start node to one or more goal nodes in a weighted graph.

## 🚀 Features

- Implements **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)** without using any external libraries.
- Processes a graph defined in the code with weights and multiple goal nodes.
- Returns all possible paths to the goal nodes along with their costs.
- Clear and easy-to-read implementation for learning purposes.

## 📖 Problem Statement

- **Start Node**: `S`
- **Goal Nodes**: `G1`, `G2`, `G3`
- **Objective**: Find the least-cost paths from the start node to all goal nodes, displaying the paths and their costs.
